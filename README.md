# 🛡️ Red Team Write-ups & Lab Reports

Welcome to my collection of **Red Teaming and Penetration Testing write-ups**.

This repository contains **PDF reports** documenting my solutions to various:
- Red Team labs  
- Penetration testing training environments  
- VulnHub machines  
- Other intentionally vulnerable systems used for practice  

These write-ups showcase my methodology, reasoning, and cybersecurity learning journey.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
> All activities described in these reports were performed on legal, intentionally vulnerable environments.  
> No unauthorized or illegal testing was performed.  
> These materials are strictly for **education and ethical cybersecurity research**.
